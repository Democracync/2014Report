      A message from our Executive Director
    </h2>
    <p class="center">
      Thanks to you, we’ve made great strides implementing the strategic plan our board adopted
      in December 2013. We added 3,500 new supporters, established another community-based
      coalition, developed a new in-office volunteer program to support our field work, and initiated
      the Democracy Fellows program. We look forward with excitement as we hire new staff, “deepen
      the bench” by increasing leadership responsibilities among staff and volunteers, and organize
      endlessly for a democracy “of, by, and for the people.”

    <h1>15 Years of Democracy Summer</h1>
  </div>

  <div class="section info">
      <p class="center">2014 marked the 15th anniversary of our summer
        internship program. Democracy Summer is a lifechanging,
        hands-on internship experience for
        college students from across the state. They work
        in organizing teams based in Durham, Charlotte,
        Fayetteville, Rocky Mount or Winston-Salem to
        empower local volunteers and advocate for policies
        that improve democracy. In 2014, we provided
        stipends to several of them to continue organizing on their
        campuses as part of a new Millennial Voter Partnership with
        three other state groups. With your support, we’re successfully
        training tomorrow’s social justice organizers and leaders.
